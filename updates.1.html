                    <h4>Early September 2017- Mid September 2017</h4>
                    <h5>Objective: Create a functioning game or story</h5>

                    <h5>Project Type: Peer Project (Pairs)</h5>

                        For the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> project, my partner and I were tasked to make a 
                        game using the Scratch engine. Besides this, the door to creative freedom was open. In return, our group decided to work on an RPG, or a role-playing game, that allows 
                        the player to progress through worlds, level up, and fight monsters. Many bugs started springing up, but nearly all were resolved by simply looking at the code. This took the most time in the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172822672/#player" target="_blank">project</a>. In the meantime, our group also had to complete an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p2AgzHPMviG6ceSADjipIsRNCG7oODp6j5Bq7-_CNlI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">online notebook</a>, which contained logs and general information on how the project was made and the progression of creation. 
                        The criteria for grading the project was located on an <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/dublinusd.org/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">instruction document</a> with an attached rubric on the same document. The end result/grade was a relatively high for our group, as we managed to accomplish much work in the limited time frame. 
                        Through this two-week project, I learned the basics of variables and functions as well as learned how to efficiently use the Scratch engine.

                    <h3>Image Manipulation Project</h3>
                    <h4>Early March 2018- Mid March 2018</h4>
                    <h5>Objective: Create functions that can alter an image. Client: Product</h5>
                    <h5>Principles of Software Engineering</h5>
                    <h5>Project Type: Peer Project (Pairs)</h5>
                    <h5>
                        For the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HKFcKs759S3JotlTxOK-eOj750g2DmRVyB5zY5Tz4MY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Image Manipulation Project</a>, our group had to make functions that can alter an image in order to satisfy our client.
                        Our client was a company that was trying to advertise a product. This company was Pear technologies (Fictional). For us, this was one of the most difficult projects in the CSE class as we ran into issue upon issue. In order to fix the 
                        the issues, we went through every line of code to look for incorrect code. Most of the bugs were actually just caused by incorrect method usage and therefore were solved on the most part.
                        The project also had an online notebook to track our data and changes for the images that we were manipulating (four images).
                        In my opinion, I think our project satisfied the client well and in general worked decently at the end. Throughout this project, I learned many concepts, mainly the skill of debugging and the ability to properly image manipulate using the python code.
