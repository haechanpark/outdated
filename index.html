My name is Kevin Park, and my goal is to become a software engineer or a computer scientist. I would like to work at Google or Apple to create and program systems and utilities for the customers to have a simpler digital experience. I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School, taking Honors Principles of Engineering, AP Chemistry, and Precalculus. I am also an assistant teacher for a robotics club and a vice-president of a programming and design club known as Gamedev, which is a club that designs and creates games utilizing code. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer, I will continue to excel at these things, as well as take and focus on engineering courses such as AP Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I also plan on attending a four-year college, aiming for the University of Los Angeles and the University of Davis majoring in computer science, in order to continue pursuing my goal.

                       Again, my end goal is to become a software engineer, and this dream has persisted ever since I was a kid. As a kid, I always looked at engineering as a possible career but at age 10, I realized Software Engineering was my dream. When I was just 9, I saw my cousin as a software engineer in his workplace and because of this I always looked up to become a software engineer. After doing research, I found out that software engineers create programs, manage systems, and much more, a job that I believed, and still do believe, I would enjoy. Recently, I found out that many people in the world are lost in the digital world and in need of help, and in the future, I hope to stop this and create simple and life-saving applications for the general public.

                    <p class="wakanda">
                       As an efficient, versatile, and focused student, I frequently find that getting what I desire such as achievements and more are all possible if you put in the effort, meaning I am positive that I would fit rigorous lifestyles. These traits are shown in my numerous activities that I balance all at once, such as being the Vice-President of Gamedev and working on practicing my academics and my instrument, the violin. I am also keen on focusing, which ties into my efficiency and versatility as a person. Many in students in high school suffer from sleep deprivation due to long studying hours, however, I tend to finish schoolwork along with my job and violin practice within 3 hours allowing me to rest afterward and have an abundance of sleep.

                    <p class="wakanda">
                        Although I have been in high school for a short amount of time, I still achieved many of my smaller goals as well. Last year in 2017, I had a cultural event with the San Francisco Mayor and won a culture award for representing Korea. I also looked toward engineering based achievements as well. Just recently, our team for the club Envirotech won the 2nd place in the ROV Regional Competition. Building the robot and buying the parts was extremely time consuming but I still pushed forward. Alongside these achievements, I also self-taught myself how to code in languages such as Python and Java.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wakanda">
                       While I am only a sophomore in high school, I have learned that working toward an ultimate goal will bring me farther than even that goal. Through this goal, I have learned that I am highly efficient and focused on my work, taking the initiative whenever possible. Having been self-taught coding languages as well such as Python and Java, I have a growing desire to become a leading figure in the world of engineering. From these experiences, I learned that the world is based on practice and work, and I focus on these two aspects on a daily basis. Thank you for reading my page and I recommend to look around further on my portfolio.
